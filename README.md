## Instructions

This a classic rendition of a card matching game. The player will select two cards at a time to see if they are a match. Once the user selects one card to check for a match, they cannot unselect it. They must select another card to check for a match. If the cards match, they will remain in a face up position. If the cards do not match, they will flip face down and the player can make another move.

This game also provides the player with a star rating. The best rating is three stars. The worst rating is one star. Every player starts with three stars. The more moves that are made, the less stars the player will be able to keep.

At the end of the game, a screen will pop up with the player's game stats including the amount of time spent playing, a game star rating, and the number of moves made. There will be an option to play a new game or to simply close the window.

There is a restart button on the top right if a player chooses to abandon their current game to begin a new one.
